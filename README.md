Dear Kaggle Team,

We hope this code is clear. As we are doctors without formal training our systems are probably a little bit spicy
(esoteric?) but hopefully they are clear.

We worked on the 2 different pipelines used by our system separately.

The 3D CNN pathway (the top blue pathway on the figure) is trained using the system outlined in the 'cnn3d' folder.

The 2D CNN pathway (the bottom green pathway on the figure) is trained using the system outlines in the 'cnn2d' folder.
